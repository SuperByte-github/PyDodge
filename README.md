#### ABOUT

This game was made in just a week because everyday a very small period of time, this game was developed so it took a week. This is so easy that you can aslo make a clone of it very easily but I'm planning to develop it in a different way. Any other can join me (currently looking for a good collaborator).

#### HOW TO PLAY

The countdown starts when you run the program.
Then you will see a blue ship with missiles coming from the left.
Use UP and DOWN arrows to move your ship and dodge the missiles.
Top-Left is the score.
Bottom-Left is your health, if you touch one missile then it will reduce you HP by 1.
You will teleport your ship to the bottom if you touch the top and vice-versa.
You will see hearts coming, if you touch them it will increase the hp by 1.
