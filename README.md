#### ABOUT

This game was made in just a week because everyday a very small period of time. Currently the game is so simple that you can also make a clone of this game ver easily if you know basics of pygame. I'm currently looking for a good collaborator for me (looking for a programming teammate).

#### HOW TO PLAY

The countdown starts when you run the program.
Then you will see a blue ship with missiles coming from the left.
Use UP and DOWN arrows to move your ship and dodge the missiles.
Top-Left is the score.
Bottom-Left is your health, if you touch one missile then it will reduce you HP by 1.
You will teleport your ship to the bottom if you touch the top and vice-versa.
You will see hearts coming, if you touch them it will increase the hp by 1.
